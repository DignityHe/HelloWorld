# HelloWorld
The first try of programming on Github!
My name is Dignity He  and I am from China. I graduated from XJTU one year ago. I majored in Mechnical engineering and I got a job. However, the traditional industy in China is really a shit! So I decide to program to get a better job with higher feedback. I plan to get to the NJU software college and get a master degree.
I hope I can change my denisty by these codes! Common on!
